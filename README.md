# odin-recipes
This is a simple HTML based project used to challenge me to create a basic multi-page website. The theme of the site is recipes where I created a separate HTML page for each included recipe, which is linked in the navigation. 

This project is based on The Odin Project's Foundation course recipes project. The instructions can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#assignment
