    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3tbsp of sugar</li>
        <li>4tsp of baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cream of tartar or 3/4tsp of more baking powder</li>
        <li>1 Cup milk</li>
        <li>3/4 cup COLD butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees.</li>
        <li>The secret to excellent biscuits is COLD BUTTER. Really cold. Many times 
            the biscuit dough gets worked so much that the butter softens before the 
            biscuits even go in the oven. Try cutting the butter into small pieces and 
            stick back in the fridge pulling out only when ready to incorporate into the dough.</li>
        <li>Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl. </li>
        <li>Use a pastry cutter to cut cold butter into flour mixture. Don't go too 
            crazy here - you want to see small, pea-sized pieces of butter throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Add in the milk and egg and mix just until the ingredients are combined. The dough will 
            be sticky but don't keep working it. You should be able to see the butter pieces in the dough.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a generously floured surface. Sprinkle some flour on to the top 
            of dough so it won't stick to your fingers and knead 10-15 times. If the dough is super 
            sticky just sprinkle on some additional flour.</li>
        <li>Pat the dough out to 3/4 - 1 inch thickness and cut with a biscuit cutter or glass. 
            I ended up with nine this time but depending on who is snacking on biscuit dough, I can get up to 12 biscuits. </li>
        <li>Place the biscuits on a lightly greased baking sheet or parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until golden brown on top.</li>
    </ol>
