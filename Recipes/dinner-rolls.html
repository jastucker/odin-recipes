  <p>My family has an undeniable love for soft, buttery dinner rolls, and they’re a 
    staple at our mealtime gatherings. As soon as they emerge from the oven, the 
    golden-brown tops beckon us with their warm, inviting scent. Each roll is pillowy 
    soft, with a rich, buttery flavor that melts in your mouth. We can’t resist tearing 
    them apart, the steam rising as we slather on even more butter, savoring every bite. 
    Whether we’re enjoying a holiday feast or a simple weeknight dinner, those dinner rolls 
    bring us together, turning every meal into a cozy, comforting occasion filled with 
    laughter and shared stories. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 -5 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rapid rise, instant yeast</li>
        <li>⅓ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1½ cups warm milk</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 3 cups of flour, yeast, sugar, salt, warm milk, butter, 
            and egg in the bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
        <li>Attach the dough hook and turn the mixer on to the lowest speed and 
            mix until flour is incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary.</li>
        <li>Increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup flour and blend with the dough hook until incorporated. And another 1/2 cup 
            flour and repeat, mixing at medium speed for another 2 minutes until a ball of dough is formed.</li>
        <li>Add additional flour as necessary. The dough should be slightly sticky and soft and pulling 
            away from the edge of the bowl. </li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl and cover with a towel or plastic wrap. 
            Let rise for 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Remove the towel or plastic wrap and deflate the dough by punching down lightly. </li>
        <li>Pinch off pieces of the dough and form 24 rolls. You can weigh them to keep the rolls close to the 
            same size. Mine were about 2 ounces each but this will vary depending on how much 
            flour you added.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolls to a lightly greased quarter baking sheet or 9 x 13 baking dish. Cover with 
            a towel or plastic wrap and let rise for an additional 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Bake the rolls for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown and cooked 
            through. If the rolls are getting too brown, just tent the rolls with foil.</li>
        <li>Remove rolls and brush hot rolls with the melted butter. Serve immediately or store cooled rolls 
            in a plastic bag for up to 3 days.</li>
    </ol>
