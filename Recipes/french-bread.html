  <p>My family has a special fondness for French bread, and it’s become a 
    must-have at our meals. The moment we crack open a fresh loaf, the crisp crust gives 
    way to the soft, airy interior, releasing that irresistible, yeasty aroma that fills the 
    kitchen. We love tearing off chunks to dip in olive oil or slathering them with butter, savoring the 
    way the flavors meld together. Whether it’s accompanying a hearty soup or being used for sandwiches, 
    French bread elevates every dish. It’s not just about the taste; sharing that warm, freshly baked bread 
    around the table brings us together, turning every meal into a comforting experience filled with laughter and love. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp yeast</li>
        <li>1 tbsp white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>6-61/2 cups flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a large standing mixer, combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water (warmed between 100-110 degrees F). 
            Take a spatula, and stir it around a couple of times. Then let it sit for about 15 minutes so that the yeast 
            activates. You should see a bubbly mixture when it’s ready.</li>
        <li>Start by adding the salt and about four cups of flour to the mixer. Let the mixer run, and occasionally 
            scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Gradually add more flour until you get a nice dough consistency. 
            It should be slightly sticky, but easy to handle.</li>
        <li>Grease a large bowl with canola or olive oil. Remove the dough from the mixer, and form it into a ball, punching it down so that it becomes smooth. Then place it in the bowl seem side down and cover it with a clean dishtowel.
            Place the bowl in a warm corner of your kitchen and let rise until approximately doubled in size. The rise may be different each time and will vary depending on where you live.</li>
        <li>Once the bread rises, it’s time to form the dough into desired shapes. Prepare bread pans or jelly roll pans with baking spray.
            Add a little oil to a pastry mat or a large flat surface (a cutting board works too), and form sections of dough into oblong shapes for large French bread, or into smaller shapes for buns or smaller loaves. Another option is baking a round of dough in a cast iron skillet.</li>
        <li>Cover dough with clean dish towels and let it rise again, until almost doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Use a sharp serrated edge knife (or a bread lame) to cut diagonal slits in the tops of the bread. Beat one large egg (with a splash of water), and using a pastry brush, spread a thin layer over the tops of bread/rolls. Add a sprinkle of kosher salt.
            When scoring the bread, make sure you use a very sharp knife or a bread lame (with a razor blade) to ensure that the cuts are quick and to avoid deflating the loaves.
        <li>Bake bread in a preheated 400 degree oven, until done, approximately 25 minutes. The bottoms should be slightly browned, and the tops a nice golden brown. Remove bread to a cooling rack.
        </li>
